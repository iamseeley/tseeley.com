it's the evening, and i'm taking a break from coding to write this. :)

it's been a few days since my last update, and i've spent most of my time working to get my web analytics tracker shareable.

it's hard to decide if i should add more date filtering capabilties... 

i just want a high-level look at my website view data. overall dashboard w/ total, daily, weekly, monthly views -- top paths, top referrers, etc... and site specific dashboards. okay, this is me deciding. there won't be any fancy date filtering. we are staying minimal! 

also, in the past few days i've read more of [sicp](https://mitp-content-server.mit.edu/books/content/sectbyfn/books_pres_0/6515/sicp.zip/index.html) / completed more [exercises](https://github.com/iamseeley/sicp).

i started [*The New Media Reader*](http://www.newmediareader.com/about.html), and read the first essay: Jorge Luis Borges' [*The Garden of Forking Paths*](https://web.mit.edu/uricchio/Public/television/documentary/Borges_GardenOfForkingPaths.pdf). it's interesting how this piece is said to have inspiried interpretations of quantum mechanics and the creation of hypertext fiction -> hypertext. 

wish me luck on my new media journey and finishing this web analytics tracker project haha.

here's a sneak peek of "mySites" ui:
