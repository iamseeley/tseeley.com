title: init web analytics

now that i have two people reading my posts on here, it's time to setup a web analytics service...

to track my site's usage, i've started making a simple analytics solution on [val.town](https://val.town). i'll share the code when i get a little further along!

so far i've created a module that tracks and records page views, referrers, and other basic visitor information. the data is stored in my val town sqlite database.

i started working on a dashboard to view the data, taking inspiration from [udara's](https://udara.io) amazing [stats](https://github.com/UdaraJay/Stats/tree/main) dashboard.


didn't have a whole lot of time to work on it today. more to come soon.
