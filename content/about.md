<img  width='300'  src='https://res.cloudinary.com/dcwnusepx/image/upload/v1721414549/tseeley/profile.jpg'> 

my name is thomas seeley. i like building for the web and creating useful, fun software.

i spend my time making things and trying to get better at making things.

in a past life i took lots of [photos](/photos), converted an ambulance into a [campervan](/posts/shelby-the-vanbulance) and drove it across the united states, built a [sauna](/posts/sauna), and went on many other [adventures](/posts/adventures) :).

over the past few years i've embarked on my biggest adventure yet â€” learning to program, which was kickstarted by an interest in startups. 

<!-- you can read more about why i learned to program [here](/posts/why-i-learned-to-program). -->

i'm currently pursuing a ms in cs, focusing on intelligent systems and software engineering.
