my name is thomas seeley. i like building for the web and creating useful, fun software.

i spend my time making things and trying to get better at making things.

i'm currently pursuing a ms in cs, focusing on data mining and intelligent systems, and software engineering.

in a past life i took lots of [photos](/photos), converted an ambulance into a [campervan](/posts/shelby-the-vanbulance) and drove it across the united states, built a [sauna](/posts/sauna), and went on many other [adventures](/posts/adventures) :).
