so, it happened sort of by accident, sort of on purpose. 

the year was 2021 i was in my junior year of undergrad studying business management and entrepreneurship. 

at that point in my degree my classes were mostly focus courses. so, for me i was taking some new venture courses, a design thinking course, project management, and a business analytics course.
