## hello world

soooo. i've never been great at writing. 

i regret it, but writing is something i've avoided. i thought it wasn't for me, so i didn't bother to work on it. i would make things instead! 

unfortunately or fortunately?. it helps to be able to explain the things you make to others if you want the thing to [succeed](/posts/succeed). 

i've started to recognize that the context within which you create something and the story behind the project can be as important as the project itself.

so writing is something i should be able to do well because i want my projects to have an impact.

when people can see the journey behind a project, when you take them behind the scenes, they're more likely to connect with it on a personal level.

<div class="section-break-container">
    <div class="section-break-line"></div>
    <span class="section-break-icon">âœ¦</span>
  </div>

*how will i get better at writing?* 

well, i'm going to write a lot more. starting with this post :). 

most of what i plan on writing will be programming related: projects i'm working on, thoughts on things i find interesting in the realm of software and web development, and maybe a personal story every once in a while.

will try to keep punctuation and grammatical errors to a minimum...

here's to becoming better communicators and more well-rounded creators!
